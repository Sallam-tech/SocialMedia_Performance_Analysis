ðŸ“Š Social Media Performance Analysis â€“ Internee.pk Internship Project
This project is part of my internship with Internee.pk, focused on analyzing social media performance using data-driven methods. The goal of the task is to examine Instagram post insights and evaluate which types of content perform best in terms of engagement.

The dataset used is a simulated collection of Instagram posts inspired by Internee.pkâ€™s official page. It includes 10 entries with key performance metrics such as likes, comments, shares, reach, and impressions. Each post is labeled by type (Image, Reel, Carousel) and date, allowing for a temporal and categorical analysis of content strategy.

In this project, I calculated the Engagement Rate for each post using the formula:

java
Copy
Edit
Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Reach Ã— 100
This metric helps determine which posts created the most interaction relative to their reach. After computing engagement rates, I identified the highest-performing content and visualized trends using Python, specifically with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

The Jupyter Notebook includes a full breakdown of the analysis, along with visualizations that clearly highlight which types of posts yield better results. A bar chart shows engagement rate trends over time, making it easier to understand performance patterns.

This task helped me strengthen my skills in:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Calculating custom metrics

Data visualization

Drawing actionable insights from analytics

All code, data, and visual outputs are included in this repository for review. This project reflects how data can be used to improve social media decision-making in real-world scenarios
